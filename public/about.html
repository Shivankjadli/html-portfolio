However, as the series progresses, it becomes apparent that there is more to Itachi than meets the eye.
  
  One of the defining elements of Itachi's character is his mysterious past and the choices he makes throughout the series. It is revealed that he was once a loyal member of the Uchiha clan, a clan that was planning a coup against the Hidden Leaf Village due to perceived mistreatment. In order to protect the village and prevent further conflict, Itachi made the difficult decision to wipe out his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. This act is one of the most shocking and controversial moments in the series, and it casts Itachi in a morally ambiguous light.
